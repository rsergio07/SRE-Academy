## **Overview**

Incident Management is a core practice in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), focused on the rapid detection, response, resolution, and learning from unexpected disruptions in services. Effective incident management reduces downtime, minimizes business impact, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.

---

## **What is an Incident in SRE?**

An **incident** is any unplanned event that disrupts or degrades a service’s normal operation, potentially impacting customers or business goals. Examples include system outages, performance degradation, security breaches, or data loss.

**Key Points:**
- Not every alert is an incident, but every incident should trigger a well-defined response process.
- Clear criteria for declaring an incident help teams act quickly and consistently.

---

## **Incident Lifecycle Stages**

### **Detection**

- **Goal:** Identify incidents as early as possible, ideally before customers are affected.
- **How:** Automated monitoring (metrics, logs, synthetic checks), user reports, and alerting systems.

### **Triage**

- **Goal:** Assess the severity, scope, and impact of the incident.
- **How:** Assign incident severity, gather initial facts, involve the right responders, and set priorities.

### **Response & Mitigation**

- **Goal:** Contain and minimize the impact of the incident.
- **How:** Execute runbooks, apply temporary workarounds or mitigations, communicate status, and escalate as needed.

### **Resolution**

- **Goal:** Fully restore service and fix the root cause.
- **How:** Deploy a permanent solution, validate recovery, and ensure all systems are back to normal.

### **Postmortem & Review**

- **Goal:** Learn from the incident to improve systems and processes.
- **How:** Analyze what happened, identify contributing factors, and document improvements to prevent recurrence.

---

## **Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Incident Commander (IC):** Leads the response and coordinates tasks.
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** Provide technical expertise to diagnose and resolve the incident.
- **Communications Lead:** Manages updates to stakeholders and customers.
- **Scribe:** Documents actions, decisions, and timelines during the incident.
- **On-call Responder:** First point of contact for alerts and initial triage.

---

## **Communication During Incidents**

Clear, timely communication is essential for effective incident response.

### **War Room**

- **Definition:** A dedicated (virtual or physical) space where the incident response team coordinates efforts.
- **Best Practice:** Use a Slack channel, Zoom call, or other collaboration tool for real-time communication and decision-making.

### **Updates and Communication Tools**

- **Internal Updates:** Share progress with the response team and organization—suggest every 15–30 minutes during active incidents.
- **External Updates:** Keep customers informed via status pages, email, or official channels.
- **Tools:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Statuspage, email templates.

**Pro Tip:** Designate a communications lead to ensure updates are frequent, clear, and consistent.

---

## **Incident Severity and Prioritization**

- **Severity Levels:** Define clear categories (e.g., Sev-1, Sev-2, Sev-3) based on impact and urgency.
- **Escalation:** Higher severity incidents require faster response and more resources.
- **Example:**
  - **Sev-1:** Complete outage, high business/customer impact.
  - **Sev-2:** Partial outage or degraded performance, moderate impact.
  - **Sev-3:** Minor issues, no immediate customer impact.

---

## **Incident Management Tools**

- **Alerting & Escalation:** PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps
- **Collaboration:** Slack, Teams, Zoom
- **Documentation:** Jira, GitHub Issues, Google Docs
- **Status Updates:** Statuspage, custom dashboards

---

## **Blameless Postmortem and Continuous Improvement**

A **blameless postmortem** transforms incidents into learning opportunities and system improvements.

### **Root Cause Analysis & The 5 Whys**

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Go beyond symptoms to identify underlying causes.
- **The 5 Whys:** Ask “why?” repeatedly (typically five times) to uncover the chain of events leading to the incident.
- **Example:**
  1. Why did the service go down? Because the database was overloaded.
  2. Why was the database overloaded? Because a new query was inefficient.
  3. Why was the new query inefficient? Because it lacked an index.
  4. Why was the index missing? Because it wasn’t specified in the requirements.
  5. Why weren’t requirements clear? Because we lack a review process for DB changes.

### **Preventing Recurrence**

- **Action Items:** Document and track concrete steps to address root causes (e.g., add monitoring, implement reviews).
- **Follow-up:** Ensure action items are completed and verified.
- **Culture:** Focus on fixing systems, not blaming individuals.

---

## **Example Incident Scenario**

1. **Detection:** PagerDuty alert for high error rates in the login API.
2. **Triage:** IC gathers the team, determines it’s a Sev-1 (users can’t log in).
3. **Response:** Team joins a Slack war room, applies a hotfix to the API, and updates the status page every 20 minutes.
4. **Resolution:** Full service restored, hotfix confirmed.
5. **Postmortem:** Team reviews incident, uses the 5 Whys, and documents action items to prevent recurrence.

---

## **Summary**

Incident management is essential for reliable, resilient services. By preparing for incidents, fostering clear communication, practicing blameless postmortems, and continually improving, teams can reduce downtime, increase user trust, and strengthen their engineering culture.
